# Shake'n'Wake
Multi-functional alarm clock application that features a shake-to-snooze/cancel function, day/night mode, vibrate and snooze options with multiple available languages.

The app makes use of MVVM architecture while sticking to XML written UI. The alarm can run in the background, but if force closed will cancel all alarms.

As a continuous work in progress, I am constantly improving the current features and adding new functionality to the application.
