# Shake'n'Wake
Multi-functional alarm clock that must be physically shaken to be snoozed/cancelled.
The alarm has day/night mode, vibrate and snooze options as well as multiple available languages.


The app makes use of MVVM architecture while sticking to XML written UI along with Activities and Fragments. 
The alarm can run in the background, but if force closed will cancel all alarms.

This is still a work in progress and I am looking to implement more feautures whilst continuing to improve the current features.
